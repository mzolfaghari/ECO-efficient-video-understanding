  * cuDNN v5 support, featuring the super fast WINOGrad Convolution and cuDNN implementation of BatchNormalization.
- Dec 23, 2015
  * Refactored cudnn wrapper to control overall memory consumption. Will automatically find the best algorithm combination under memory constraint.

### Features
- `VideoDataLayer` for inputing video data.

- Parallel training with multiple GPUs.
- Newest cuDNN integration.
- Slim memory footprints in both training and testing,

### Usage

#### *See more in* [Wiki](https://github.com/yjxiong/caffe/wiki).

Generally it's the same as the original caffe. Please see the original README.
Please see following instruction for accessing features above. More detailed documentation is on the way.

- Video/optic flow data
  - First use the [optical flow extraction tool](https://github.com/wanglimin/dense_flow) to convert videos to RGB images and opitcal flow images.
  - A new data layer called `VideoDataLayer` has been added to support multi-frame input. See the UCF101 sample for how to use it.
  - **Note:** The `VideoDataLayer` can only input the optical-flow images generated by the tool listed above.
- Fixed corner cropping augmentation
  - Set `fix_crop` to `true` in `tranform_param` of network's protocol buffer definition.
- "Multi-scale" cropping augmentation
  - Set `multi_scale` to `true` in `transform_param`
  - In `transform_param`, specify `scale_ratios` as a list of floats smaller than one, default is `[1, .875, .75, .65]`
  - In `transform_param`, specify `max_distort` to an integer, which will limit the aspect ratio distortion, default to `1`
- cuDNN v5
 - The cuDNN v5 wrapper has optimized engines for convolution and batch normalization.
 - The solver protobuf config has a parameter `richness` which specifies the total GPU memory in MBs available to the cudnn convolution engine as workspaces. Default `richness` is 300 (300MB). Using this parameter you can control the GPU memory consumption of training, the system will find the best setup under the memory limit for you.
- Training with multiple GPUs
  - Requires OpenMPI > 1.7.4 ([Why?](https://www.open-mpi.org/faq/?category=runcuda)). **Remember to compile your OpenMPI with option `--with-cuda`**
  - Specify list of GPU IDs to be used for training, in the solver protocol buffer definition, like `device_id: [0,1,2,3]`
  - Compile using cmake and use `mpirun` to launch caffe executable, like
```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DUSE_MPI=ON
make && make install
mpirun -np 4 ./install/bin/caffe train --solver=<Your Solver File> [--weights=<Pretrained caffemodel>]
```
**Note**: actual batch_size will be `num_device` times `batch_size` specified in network's prototxt.
- Runtime memory optimization
  - Memory optimization drastically reduces memory usage (half for training and almost all for testing) by
  safely sharing underlying storage of a series of blobs.
  - For usage and the mechanism behind the scene, see the [Wiki Page](https://github.com/yjxiong/caffe/wiki/Memory-Optimization)

### Extension
Currently all existing data layers sub-classed from `BasePrefetchingDataLayer` support parallel training. If you have newly added layer which is also sub-classed from `BasePrefetchingDataLayer`, simply implement the virtual method
```C++
inline virtual void advance_cursor();
```
Its function should be forwarding the "data cursor" in your data layer for one step. Then your new layer will be able to provide support for parallel training.
